# Pixel

ðŸš¨ **Pixel is new and experimental. Only use if you are feeling dangerous.** ðŸš¨

Pixel is a visual regression tool that helps you replace manual testing with
automated tests that catch web ui regressions when developing MediaWiki.

It uses [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) under the hood.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nicholasray/pixel.git && cd pixel
```

```sh
$ cd pixel
```
